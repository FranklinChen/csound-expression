Csound-expression is a framework for computer music.
With the help of the library we can create our instruments on the fly. 
A few lines in the interpreter is enough to get the cool sound going
out of your speakers. It can be used for simple daily sound-file processing 
or for a full-blown live performances.

Let's look at how we can create computer music with Haskell.
