Csound-expression is a framework for computer music.
It generates Csound files out of Haskell code.
The Csound is a programming language designed for computer music.
Csound-expression makes Csound much more friendly and easy to use.

With the help of the library we can create our instruments on the fly. 
A few lines in the interpreter is enough to get the cool sound going
out of your speakers. 

Let's look at how we can create computer music with Haskell.
