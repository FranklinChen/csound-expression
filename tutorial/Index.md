Csound-expression guide
===============================================================================

Welcome to the simplest text based synthesizer. 

Csound-expression is a framework for creation of computer music.
It's a Haskell library to make Csound much more friendly.
It generates Csound files out of Haskell code.

Csound is really awesome. It features unlimited polyphony, hundreds of synth-units 
including FM, granular synth, frequency domain transforms and many more.
Midi and OSC control, compatible with JACK. With JACK it's easy to use with your DAW
of choice. It can run on mobile devices and even in the web browser. 

But Csound is clumsy. It's an old  C-style language. We can boost it with 
functional programming. The Csound-expresion gives you eloquence of Haskell 
combined with power of Csound.
